```I promise to never use my private key associated with real money in plain text on any website, including this one. I understand that if I do, I will lose all of my money.```

Summary:
When you look to deploy
with real money, you should use either:
1. A password encrypted keystore
2. Something like thirdweb deploy

The idea is you never want to have
your private key or password
ANYWHERE written in plain text
(Aka, you always want it encrypted)
